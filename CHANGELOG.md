## 2026-06-02 — Durable mutation queue: close every data-loss path from the code review

A max-effort code review of the 2026-04-29 release (`e01f722`) found that the snapshot-based reliability layer, despite its intent, still **silently lost data** in several ways. This release reworks the sync layer and closes all 15 findings. Both clients were redeployed live (GitHub Pages + GAS deployment `@14`); the deploy windows had an empty Session, so no in-progress feeding was disrupted.

### The core rework — `index.html`

The localStorage **snapshot** model (`saveLocalSnapshot` / `maybeRestoreLocalSnapshot`) is **removed entirely** and replaced with a **durable outbound mutation queue** (`mutationQueue`, key `feedingManager.queue.v1`):

- Every local edit is enqueued as `{op, dogId, payload}` (`op` ∈ `add|update|delete|mealType`). `sync*` are now thin enqueue wrappers; `flushQueue()` drains in order, removing an item only after its POST succeeds, and retries on the next cycle (dropping after 5 rejections so it can't wedge).
- **`applyRemoteState()` now MERGES** the server snapshot with the queue instead of wholesale-replacing `dogs`/`pens` — the server is authoritative only for dogs with no pending op (pending adds kept, updates re-applied, deletes suppressed). This is what stops the silent erase of offline edits on reconnect.
- The crash-recovery path is automatic: the queue persists across reloads, is merged into view (so unsynced dogs are visible offline), and flushes on reconnect — no `confirm()` prompt, no snapshot to overwrite.

### Connection handling — `index.html`

- All GAS calls go through **`gasFetch()`** (AbortController, 12s timeout) so slow/dead requests can't stack on flaky wifi; the 7s heartbeat gained an in-flight guard.
- The offline decision is **debounced**: `isOnline` is optimistic and flips false only after **2** consecutive failures (reset by any success). A single transient blip no longer raises the banner or blocks Submit.
- `updateConnectionUI()` is the single owner of the banner + Submit button; **Submit requires `isOnline && queue empty`**. The heartbeat ping only marks *reachable* + triggers a flush — it never clears the "unsynced" state by itself (it used to mask failed writes).
- Removed the redundant `consecutiveSyncFailures`/`lastSuccessfulSyncAt` state and the full-state snapshot writes.

### Backend — `feeding_report_backend_v2.js`

- **Telegram delivery is now gated:** free-text names are Markdown-escaped (`escapeTelegramMarkdown`), and `submitReport` only `clearSession()`s + returns `success:true` after a confirmed send; on failure it returns `{success:false, telegramSent:false}` and keeps Temp+Session for retry. (Previously an unbalanced `_`/`*` in a name 400'd the send, yet the session was wiped and success reported — total silent report loss.)
- `finalName` precedence changed to `matchedName || name || inputName` so a fuzzy-single-match dog reports its resolved name (and its parent email resolves) instead of the raw typed text.
- Per-dog fields are normalized at the top of the submit loop: `supplementTypes` coerced to an array (no more `.join` throw after the Temp tab was cleared) and `status` resolved via `hasOwnProperty` (unknown status defaults to `All` with a logged warning instead of a silent mis-map).

### Findings status (15 total)

- **Fixed & deployed:** #1–#13 (the six Critical, three High, and the false-offline/timeout #10 + backend-normalization #13 Mediums). #11/#12/#15 were largely resolved as a side-effect of the queue rework.
- **Moot:** #14 (server-side `new Date()` timezone) — the Apps Script manifest is `Europe/London`, correct for the business.
- **Cosmetic leftover:** #15 — read-path fetches not yet consolidated into one `postAction` wrapper.

### Verification & deploy

- Each change was verified by a headless Node harness that loads the **actual** source (the inline `<script>` via `new Function`, the GAS file with stubbed Apps Script globals) and runs the acceptance scenarios — offline-add-survives-reconnect, crash recovery, submit-gating, telegram-failure-keeps-dogs, delete-stays-deleted, the 2-strike debounce, `gasFetch`'s abort signal, and malformed-row normalization.
- Backend deployed via `clasp` (clone → overwrite `Code.js` → `push` → `redeploy` the existing deployment to keep the `/exec` URL); endpoint smoke-tested after each push. `index.html` shipped via GitHub Pages.

## 2026-04-29 — Connection reliability & data-loss fix

Staff reported that the Feeding Report Manager (tablet) was "losing its connection" to the Feeding Display, silently caching changes locally, then failing on submit and losing all entered data. Investigation showed there is no direct connection — both apps are independent clients of a Google Apps Script (GAS) web app polling a shared `Session` sheet, and "lost connection" really meant "GAS calls are failing intermittently and the UI is silent about it." This release makes those failures loud, durable, and survivable.

### `feeding_report_backend_v2.js` (Google Apps Script)

- **`submitReport(data)` now trusts the tablet's POST body when present.** Previously it ignored `data.dogs` and re-read from the Session tab — so any local edits that hadn't synced to the sheet were lost on submit. New behaviour: if `data.dogs` is a non-empty array, use it as the source of truth; otherwise fall back to `getSessionState()` for legacy callers.
- **Robust `finalName` resolution.** Now `dog.matchedName || dog.inputName || dog.name || ''` so both POST-body and Session-tab shapes work; malformed rows are skipped with `return` instead of crashing the whole submit.
- Telegram payload, JotForm URL builder, Temp tab schema, `clearSession()`, and every other endpoint are byte-for-byte unchanged. n8n workflow not affected.

**Deployment:** new code pasted into the live Apps Script project (`Feeding manager`) and deployed as a new version. The web-app URL is unchanged.

### `index.html` (tablet UI)

- **Loud offline banner.** Full-width fixed-top red banner with a "Retry now" button, appears within ~7 seconds of any failed sync. Cannot be missed during a feeding session.
- **Active 7-second heartbeat.** Pings the lightweight `getSessionVersion` endpoint independently of the existing 5s poll loop, so connection loss is detected even mid-edit (when the regular poll is gated by `pendingDogIds`).
- **Sync-health tracking** (`markSyncFailure` / `markSyncSuccess`). Wired into every fetch call site: `pollForUpdates`, `loadSessionState`, `loadDogList`, `syncAddDog`, `syncUpdateDog`, `syncDeleteDog`, `syncMealType`, `syncClearSession`, `submitToBackend`. A single failed call flips the connection state to offline, surfaces the banner, and disables Submit. A success clears all of that and shows a "✓ Reconnected" toast.
- **Submit blocked while offline.** `#submitBtn` and `#confirmSubmitBtn` get the `disabled` attribute via `disableSubmitButton()`. `confirmSubmit()` also has a hard early-return on `!isOnline || consecutiveSyncFailures > 0` as belt-and-suspenders.
- **Submit payload widened.** `assignedDogs` now includes `inputName` and `matchedName` alongside `name`, so the GAS `finalName` resolver works regardless of which path the backend takes.
- **localStorage snapshot.** Saved at the top of every `sync*` mutation (key: `feedingManager.snapshot.v1`). On page load `maybeRestoreLocalSnapshot()` compares the snapshot against the freshly loaded session and, if there are dogs in the snapshot that aren't in the session, prompts the user to recover them and replays each through `syncAddDog`. Cleared after a successful submit and after `clearAll`.
- **Quiet sync variant.** `syncUpdateDog(id, updates, true)` skips the failure-counter bump. Used by `applyRemoteState`'s auto-rematch logic so a single bad sheet row can't flood the counter and trip the offline banner spuriously.
- **Drag-and-drop is untouched.** All touch handlers, drag state vars, the `is-dragging` body class, the `LONG_PRESS_DURATION` long-press timer, and the Android `touch-action` quirks are preserved verbatim. The new banner is `position: fixed` with its own z-index — it does not interfere with the in-progress drag layout or the body class toggle.

### What this does *not* fix

- **GAS soft quotas / cold starts.** This release makes the app *resilient* to GAS hiccups (offline banner, snapshot, replay) but doesn't eliminate them. If the offline banner appears regularly during normal use, that points at GAS rate-limit or 5xx patterns — investigate via the GAS execution dashboard.
- **Display staleness indicator.** The Feeding Display still has no "Last update X minutes ago — STALE" warning. Low priority; not part of this fix.
- **Concurrent multi-tablet edits with one offline.** The snapshot-restore model assumes a single tablet edits a feeding session at a time. If two tablets edit simultaneously while one is offline, on reconnect they could overwrite each other.

### Verification

- Both files parse cleanly (`new Function(...)` smoke test on the inline `<script>` and the GAS file).
- GAS deployed; staff confirmed "all good and works" after using it on a real session.
- Full verification matrix is documented at `.claude/plans/review-the-code-in-harmonic-beacon.md` (offline-detection, killer-scenario submit, crash recovery, submit-blocked-while-offline, drag-and-drop regression smoke test). The drag-and-drop smoke test on the actual tablet should be re-run if any drag/drop CSS or touch handler is later changed.

### Files in this folder

- `index.html` — tablet UI (offline-resilient).
- `feeding_report_backend_v2.js` — Google Apps Script source. **The deployed copy lives in the Apps Script project, not in this repo.** When you change this file, you must paste the new contents into the Apps Script editor and redeploy a new version for the change to go live.
- `n8n_workflow_v2_corrected.json` — n8n automation that reads the Temp tab and posts to JotForm. Unchanged in this release.
